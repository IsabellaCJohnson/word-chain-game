The objective of the Word Chain Game is to connect the starting word to the ending word by entering intermediary words. Each word must differ from the previous one by exactly one letter, while the other letters remain in the same order.

Here are the steps:

The game provides a starting word and an ending word.
Add intermediary words by clicking the "Add Word" button.
Each word should differ from the previous word by exactly one letter.
Use the "Submit" button to check your word chain.
Use the "Hint" button if you need a clue.
Score points based on the number of words usedâ€”the fewer words, the higher the score! You start with 100 points, 10 points are deducted per word used.
Click "Reset Game" to start with a new word chain.
If you need to remove an extra word input, use the "Remove Word" button.
